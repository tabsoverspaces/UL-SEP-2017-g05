\chapter{Software operations}
\label{chap:soptware_operations}


Explain each allowed software operations (i.e. an atomic unit of treatment, a service, a functionality) including a brief description of the operation, required parameters, optional parameters, default options, required steps to trigger the operation, assumptions upon request of the operation and expected results of executing such operation.
Describe how to recognise that the operation has successfully been executed or
abnormally terminated. The template given below (i.e. section \ref{operation:MyOperation} has to be used).

Group the operations devoted to the needs of specific actors. Common
operations to several actors may be grouped and presented once to avoid redundancy.
